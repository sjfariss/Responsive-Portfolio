            <img src="assets/images/IMG_0630.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="SJF picture">

            <p>I was born in Batavia, IL, a small town outside of Chicago. I graduated from high school when I was 16.  My Orthodontist asked if I would like to come work for him for the summer and I have spent my whole career mainly working in the Orthodontic field. I moved to FL when I was 20, to get away from those cold and gloomy IL winters and graduated with an Associate Degree from Florida State College in Jacksonville.  My studies were mainly centered around the knowledge, management and delivery of healthcare.</p>
            <p>I have held many positions over the years. Some examples of my positions are: Office Manager, "Hands On" Practice Manager for 30 offices, System and Network Administrator (where my interest and exposure to computer programming started), Director of Professional Relationships (where I travelled all over the country performing due diligence for potential acquisitions), Administrative Director at CU-Denver School of Orthodontics and Practice Management Consultant.  Today, I mostly act as a Consultant for large multi-practice organizations or Orthodontic Schools, like The Georgia School of Orthodontics (GSO) in Atlanta, GA. My specialty area in Practice Management is centered around practice growth and new office "start-ups". I have had extensive exposure to specialty administrative software programs and have often been allowed to go into server-side programming for minor modifications.  I have always been considered the "go to" person for hardware/tech issues in almost all of my positions.</p> 
            <p>If you see me looking at your teeth, don't worry! It is just out of habit. I love to see people SMILE!</p>
